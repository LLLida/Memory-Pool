* C++ header only memory pool library

- Small. 1 header file with 2 classes for usage: =lida::LocalMemoryPool= and =lida::GlobalMemoryPool=.
- STL compatible. It ideally works with =std::list=, =std::set= and =std::map=.
- Fast. You can even make it faster by preallocating memory with =reverse()=.

* Installation

  Add the repository as subdirectory in your project and 'link' the library to properly get includes:
#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
  add_subdirectory(Memory-Pool)
  target_link_libraries(YOUR_TARGET_NAME PRIVATE lida::Memory-Pool)
#+END_SRC
